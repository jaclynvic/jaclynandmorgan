## Are there showers available on site?
For guests staying onsite, there are 3 shower options. There are showers located in the men's restroom located near Scheid Hall, on the pool deck, and in Willow Glen. Please note that similar to the rest of the summer camp, these are not glamorous. Be sure to pack a towel and a pair of flip flops might not be a bad idea either.

## Is there electricity for phone charging and hair curling?
There is no electricity in the cabins, but there are outlets in the bathrooms and around the property. Be prepared to share the outlets with everyone else, and definitely bring a portable charger/extra battery for your phone if you have one!

## What is there to do in the area?
 - The property itself contains 100 acres to explore with hiking trails
 - Check out the incredible Redwoods! You can see these on site, as well as the nearby Heritage Grove trail
 - San Gregorio State beach is located only a 15 minute drive at the base of La Honda Blvd at Hwy 1.
 - There is an epic General Store located a 6 minute drive down La Honda Blvd towards the ocean that has a bar, coffee, tons of amazing trinkets, and occasionally live music!
 - Apple Jack’s Saloon in La Honda is one of our favorite spots! Built in the 1870s, this biker bar was recently named among the top 32 dive bars in the country (#12).
