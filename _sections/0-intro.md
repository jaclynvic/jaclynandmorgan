Pack your sleeping bag and dancinâ€™ shoes and join us for a weekend of celebrations under the stars!

### Camp Jacamo <br/>(aka ovy camp)<br/> San Gregorio, CA

OVY is located halfway up the San Francisco peninsula, nestled between the Pacific Ocean to the west and old growth redwoods to the east. The camp consists of 100 beautiful acres including redwoods, hilltops with amazing views, hiking trails, and a creek! Seemed like a real nice place to tie the knot.
