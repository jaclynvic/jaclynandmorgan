# About

#### We decided early on that a single evening wouldn’t be nearly enough to celebrate with you all, so we’re making this a weekend affair! Lucky for us, we have Camp Jacamo, a beautiful 100 acre summer camp, from Friday evening through Sunday morning. Guests are welcome to join for the whole weekend, or just for the big event on Saturday - choose your own adventure!

We will post a more detailed schedule as we get closer to the event, but here’s a rough idea of what to expect:

__Friday, 5/29__
Afternoon: Camp Jacamo gates open! Set up camp, play games, explore the property
Evening: Dinner, beers, partying, camp fire

__Saturday, 5/30__
Morning/Afternoon: Breakfast, Surf/yoga/hike/play games
Evening: Morgan & Jaclyn get married, everyone parties into the night

__Sunday, 5/31__
Morning: Coffee & farewell! Miss you already!
