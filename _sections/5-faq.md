# Faq

## Is this a kid-friendly event?
We love kids, but our wedding weekend will not be child-proofed! 
At this time we do not plan on having an on-site babysitter.  Please let us know if this is an issue, and we'll see what we can do!  

## Are pets allowed?
Unfortunately pets are not allowed at the camp. Please leave your furry friends at home!

## What should I expect if I’m staying in a cabin?
The cabins are very basic. There are 8 bunks and one single bed in each cabin, sleeping 9 at the most. Each bed has a vinyl mattress, and you will need to bring sleeping bag, pillows etc. There are no electrical outlets inside the cabins. Shared bathrooms with electrical outlets  are located outside of the cabins. If you have a portable charger/extra battery for your phone, we’d recommend bringing it!

## Is there cell service/Wifi at the camp?
Cell service can be spotty depending on your carrier, but Verizon seems to work pretty well. There is also WiFi access in some areas of the camp.

##  What should I wear to the wedding? 
We’ll describe the event as “dressy casual”. Most importantly, we want you to be comfortable and to dress for longevity! Last thing we want is for your uncomfortable shoes to slow you down on the dance floor. Most of the ceremony/reception will be outdoors on natural ground, so dress accordingly! We’d also suggest bringing layers, as it will get chilly in the evening. There will be plenty of room for you to store a bag/extra layers so don’t worry about packing some extra items!

## What’s the parking situation?
  There is plenty of parking on site!

## Can I use Uber/Lyft to get back to my hotel?
No, do not plan for Uber/Lyft. We’d encourage you to stay on-site Saturday night if possible, or schedule a taxi service for a ride back to your hotel.

## Can I bring an RV?
No. Sorry!
