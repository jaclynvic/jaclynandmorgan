# Location


#### GETTING THERE

Camp Jacamo is located in San Gregorio, CA, which is south of Half Moon Bay and north of Santa Cruz.

For guests who will be flying, SFO and SJC are almost equally distanced from the location. 

For guests who will be driving, there is ample parking on the property! The camp address is 5360 La Honda Rd, San Gregorio, CA 94074

**Please note: There will not be Uber/Lyft service at this location, so please plan ahead! If youâ€™re not staying on site, it might be a good idea to schedule a taxi service ahead of time, as cell service can be spotty at the camp.**

#### STAYING THERE

Guests are welcome to stay through the weekend on site! There are 12 very rustic camp cabins for groups to share and lots of space for tent camping. We may also have access to luxury glamping tents (think Fyre Festival, but actually what you paid for) depending on the level of interest. 

While most of the wedding party will be bunking up under the stars, we encourage anyone wary of the great outdoors to find accomodations in the nearby towns of Half Moon Bay or Pescadero. Both are a short 15-minute drive from the camp. We will provide some hotel options closer to the event!
